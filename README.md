# Docker workshop
A simple docker workshop for anyone who wants to learn how to use docker effectively in their day-to-day dev work.

This repo attempts to drive you through the fundamentals and into some advanced topics like docker-compose or docker's swarm mode.

This is, of course, a continuous work in progress; feel free to propose changes and spread the word.

Get started in the [0-docker-basics](https://github.com/vfa-cancc/docker-workshop/tree/master/1-running-containers) section.
